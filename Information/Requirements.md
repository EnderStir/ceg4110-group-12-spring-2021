## Discord Bot: Monster Hunter World

Monster Hunter: World (MHW) is a game, playable on console and PC, that is about hunting monsters to gather resources,
stop eco-disasters, or prevent extinction level events. In order to complete quests in the game, players need to acquire
the appropriate equipment and items. In order for the players to know the proper equipment and items, they need to gather
all the information they can about the target monster. Gathering that information takes time and effort, for some, that 
task can be considerably difficult. 

Objective: Expand functionality of the Monster Hunter: World game information database and connect it to a discord bot, 
allowing players in discord to retrieve, search, and update the data.
