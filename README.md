# ceg4110-group-12-spring-2021

1.) Requirements for this repository can be found in the main branch in the
 _Information/Requirements.md_ file. 

2.) Design information for this repository can be found in the main branch in the
 _Information/Design.md_ file. 

3.) Actions for this Repository can be found in the main branch in the 
 _Information/Actions.md_ file

4.) Minutes recorded for the weeks throughout the Spring 2021 semester can be found in the main 
branch in the _Information/minutesLog.md_ file. Keep in mind it did take us a few weeks to 
get an unspoken minutes taker going and get our feet under us in terms of getting our minutes
recorded and that process down. 

5.) Test results can be found in the Main branch in the _Test Directory_ . 

6.) The traceability should be kinda implicit.  The test file, should show you the results of 
the implementations for the designs of the requirements for the Monster Hunter World bot's
behavior. 

Implementations of our designs can be  found in the code, which is in the develop branch.
The implementations of the output table of the bot commands are found in _pTables.py_.  
The implementations for the commands, response, and requests are all found in _the main.py,
mhwRequest.py, commands.py, and running.py_ files.  

The Design.md file which is a collaborative effort of all group members. Will describe the 
design process for the Requirements. Unfortunately, this waterfall process is fairly inefficient 
and we as a group have had to add requirements later in the project design, and implementation 
phases. This has lead to some inconsistent in documentation and formatting issues in a few rare
place I am assuming in the Requirments.md and Design.md files. However, they do not show up in
the implementation and testing because that is where we have noticed the most profound tweaks 
needed to be.
